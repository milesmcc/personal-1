**I am a senior at [Phillips Academy](https://www.andover.edu/) interested in how technology affects people politically, economically, and personally. My short-term objectives include building Harpocrate — a 501(c)(3) initiative established to provide transparency in privacy policies, collaborating with CoSpace Robotics to bring accessible programming education to US students from underprivileged backgrounds, and developing Plutus — financial securities trading platform backed by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. I am also the creator of [Icy Bounce](https://icybounce.com) — a mobile arcade game featured by Apple in 70+ countries & downloaded over 250000 times, and a mentor at [Ukraine Global Scholars 501(c)(3)](https://ukraineglobalscholars.org) — a non-profit that in less than five years of existence helped more than 50 talented Ukrainian high school students receive over 15 million dollars to study in best schools worldwide.**

**In my free time I play the guitar, write electronic music, or read about finance & information security.**
