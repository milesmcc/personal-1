(Disclaimer: some of the information is projected as of October 2019. That is, it might yet not be completely true as of Summer 2019. False facts are merely estimates and are marked with *.)

**I am interested in how technology affects people politically, economically, and personally. My short-term objectives include building Harpocrate, a [Politiwatch 501(c)(3)](https://politiwatch.org/) initiative established to provide transparency in privacy policies; collaborating with CoSpace Robotics to bring accessible programming education to US students from underprivileged backgrounds; and developing Plutus, a financial technology startup backed by Silicon Valley investors. I am also the creator of [Icy Bounce](https://icybounce.com) — a mobile arcade game featured by Apple in 70+ countries with more than 250,000 downloads, and a mentor at [Ukraine Global Scholars 501(c)(3)](https://ukraineglobalscholars.org) — a non-profit that in less than five years of existence helped more than 50 talented Ukrainian high school students receive over 15 million dollars to study in the top-rated schools worldwide.**

**In my free time I play the guitar, write electronic music, or read about finance & information security.**

## Academics
#### Phillips Academy Andover, a private boarding school in Massachussetts, 2017-2020
In 2017, I received a full scholarship partially funded by Davis Scholars Foundation (see below) to attend Phillips Academy — a leading preporatory school in the United States. I came from an average Ukrainian public school in a small city of Kropyvnytskyi, and was the fourth Ukrainian student to ever attend the school in its 240 years of existence. My latest term GPA was 5.8 on 6.0 scale, and I am taking the following courses in the Fall of 2019:
- **Fluid Mechanics**, a Physics Elective (PHY630)
- **Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra**, a Math Elective (MTH650)
- **Computer Vision**, an Honors Computer Science Seminar (CSC630)
- **Accelerated Chinese Sequence**, Fourth Level Chinese (CHI420)
- An English Elective (TBD)

#### Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies (SPCS), Business & Entrepreneurship Section, 2018 
I received a full scholarship to attend a three-week-long selective summer session at Stanford University. My particular section focused in finance & investments, and I was the only Ukrainian student in the entire SPCS program in 2018.

#### Davis Scholars, 2017-present
Along with my admission to Phillips Academy in 2017, I was also selected by the admission office to become one of the few students in the school and of the ~40 students worldwide to receive a $140,000 scholarship that contributes to my tuition in the United States. Upon the Davis Scholars meeting in New York City in 2018, I built a website* for Davis Scholars that lists the scholarship recipients and their schools on an interactive 3D model of Earth (under the guidance of Lance Odden, head of the program).

#### Ukraine Global Scholars (UGS), 501(c)(3), 2016
Ukraine Global Scholars is a 501(c)(3) non-profit established in 2015 by Ukrainian Ivy League alumni who themselves received full scholarships and want to help future generations get similar education in the United States. Following my first attempt a year before, in 2016 I was selected as one of the 19 students from 500+ applicants to receive guidance with the application process to private U.S. schools. With the help of UGS, I applied to 13 independent boarding schools in the United States and gained admission to Phillips Academy, where I am currently enrolled, as well as three other preporatory schools. I also currently hold several leadership positions at UGS, described below.

## Leadership Positions & Organizations
Most of my project-based work includes knowledge in computer science in one way or another. I have started coding in 2015 by attending a free enthusiast-run [programming school](https://programming.kr.ua/en) in my city in Ukraine. I was among the first four students to ever complete their introductory C++ course, and I have been teaching myself computer science since then. That school is where I met friends who I am working with up to this day. For example, Dr. Penguin Studios mentioned later consists of three people incuding myself; all three of us were among the first four to complete the course too.

#### Admission Officer, Technology Lead, and Mentor at Ukraine Global Scholars 501(c)(3), 2016-2019
In 2018-2019, I closely worked with two UGS scholars and mentored them on the application process to U.S. boarding schools. They ultimately received over $400,000 in scholarship money and will be attending Phillips Academy and The Taft School in the Fall of 2019. In 2019, I have also become the technology lead at UGS and built an updated website for Ukraine Global Scholars* — https://ukraineglobalscholars.org/. In 2020, I will be responsible for building a new application platform. I have also become the first high school student to become an admission officer at UGS, and have since contributed significantly to selecting the new UGS cohort of most talented Ukrainian students.

#### Co-Founder at Harpocrate, a [Politiwatch](https://politiwatch.org/) 501(c)(3) initiative, 2019
Harpocrate is an initiative that strives to establish transparency in the realm of online privacy. It is a logical extension of [OpenPD](https://openpd.org/) — a standardized privacy policy standard currently in development by Politiwatch. Harpocrate ventures to create a lookup system that uses intelligent algorithms, including machine learning, to process the contents of privacy policies and present them in an easily digestible way. Such output will be displayed in a browser extension and could then be verified by companies if they write their policies in OpenPD standard, thus popularizing the standard and increasing privacy accountability online. Harpocrate is being developed in collaboration with [Miles McCain](https://rmrm.io/), the founder of Politiwatch.

#### Co-Founder at Plutus, a financial technology startup, 2019
Plutus is an innovative platform to trade financial securities, specificially options, that is currently in development. It is in its early production stage, although it is already supported by influential Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and famous investors (NDA).

#### Co-Founder at Dr. Penguin Studios (c), 2017-present
Dr. Penguin Studios is an (unregistered) indie game development company I founded that consists of three people. We have collaborated at Global Game Jam Ukraine in 2017, and have since developed [Icy Bounce](https://icybounce.com/) — a 3D arcade mobile game inspired by Crossy Road. The development took around a year, and the game was ultimately featured by Apple on the App Store in more than 70 countries in the _New Games We Like_ section. Currently, Icy Bounce has more than a quarter million downloads worldwide and is translated to 13 languages. Icy Bounce received official offers to republish by multiple billion-dollar companies (NDA), though the collaboration was never reached due to the non-competitive retention rates of Icy Bounce.

#### Co-Founder of the Electronic Music Production Club at Phillips Academy
In 2018, together with Keishi Kimura, I applied for an [Abbot Grant](https://www.andover.edu/alumni/alumni-connect/abbot-academy/abbot-academy-fund) and received $9,500 in funding to establish the infrastructure for electronic music production at Phillips Academy. We have purchased various cutting-the-edge software and hardware to make electronic music accessible to everyone at the school, and are currently working on electronic music production curriculum together with the Music Department. We have also created "Andover in A Minor" — the most viewed video on Phillips Academy's Instagram account (YouTube version: https://youtu.be/6DSYlv96ZPA). The track is completely self-composed and produced by me and Keishi, and the video is produced by the Communications Office.

#### President at [Blueshells](https://blueshells.net/), Co-President at [Techmasters](https://techmasters.io) & Computer Science Club at Phillips Academy
In 2018, I was elected the co-president of Techmasters — the oldest computer science club at Andover. I was re-elected again in 2019 and will serve as the club's co-president in 2019-2020. I will also be serving as the co-president of Computer Science Club and the president of Blueshells (a cybersecurity club) in 2019-2020. 

Over the recent years, Techmasters have created and held [PACTF](https://2019.pactf.com/) — a global online cybersecurity competition with over $20,000 worth of prizes and 1,000 participants. Its sponsors include Amazon, J.P. Morgan, DigitalOcean, ProtonMail, Cloudflare, Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Security and Privacy Institute), and Carnegie Mellon University Information Networking Institute. In 2017-2018, I was a problem writer. I have not, however, had an opportunity to contribute to PACTF in 2019.

## Music
In 2011, I have started playing the guitar after watching Tommy Emmanuel's performance of "The Finger Lakes" on YouTube. Since then, I have become a self-taught guitarist, and soon attended a music school (a separate institution  from the regular school). In less than two years, I had already participated in the "Ukraine's Got Talent" (though my performance was cut from the TV version), and had won multiple national guitar contests. I have also composed my first composition [**Life**](https://soundcloud.com/igor-barakaiev/life) at the age of 12, and since then have started to teach myself to play the piano and to compose electronic music. In 2016, I graduated from the music school with honors in four years instead of the required eight. I continue to play music; currently, I run the electronic music club and take the guitar classes at Andover. Recently, I have opened one of the concluding All-School Meetings with the "Beatles Medley" (equivalent of the following performance: https://youtu.be/O1MrQRl7V-o). 

I have messaged Tommy Emmanuel on Facebook and heard back from him multiple times. In 2015, he personally let me in to the "Meet & Greet" session before his concert in Kiev, and we [performed "The Finger Lakes" together](https://youtu.be/K6mBssDipec).

The following are several of my compositions, besides _Life_ and _Andover in A Minor_, that I am most proud of:
- My piano song, composed and performed on a MIDI-keyboard back when I did not have access to a good piano (2015): https://soundcloud.com/igor-barakaiev/time/s-5u5b6
- The following two are my latest electronic tracks:

## Achievements

#### Tianjin RoboCup Invitational under [World Intelligence Congress](http://info.wicongress.org/en), 2019
I was personally invited by Tsinghua University (Chinese No. 1 university) to represent the United States in an international robotics competition held in Tianjin, China, from May 15th to May 19th. My trip was fully sponsored by the Chinese government and included funding to bring my parents and another team member from Phillips Academy. We were the only representatives of the United States at the invitational. There, I was invited to contribute to the expansion of CoSpace Robotics to the United States in order to bring accessible computer science education to students from underprivileged backgrounds, starting in Providence, RI, and later expanding to the rest of the United States.

#### Hackathons and Programming Competitions
- [**HackExeter**](http://www.hackexeter.com/) (Spring 2019): won the "Developer's Award" in the annual hackathon hosted at Phillips Exeter Academy.
- [**MIT Blueprint**](https://blueprint.hackmit.org/) (Winter 2019): won second place in the annual hackathon hosted at the MIT Media Lab.
- [**Cyber Patriot X**](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) (Winter 2018): competed in the Platinum division with [Blueshells](https://blueshells.net/).

- **National Ukrainian Programming Olympiad** (2015, 2016): participated twice in the highest-tier selective programming competition in Ukraine (top-5 students from my city), although I have not placed top-3 from Ukraine at the Olympiad.

## Other
Over the years, I have worked on a number of projects ranging from 2D games to machine learning algorithms. I am unable to include many of those in this portfolio as most of them have been discontinued. Below is the brief list of the most interesting ones:
- **Facemoji**: a Python + OpenCV script used to draw beautiful emoji arts given a photo as an input. Examples: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z-UTtYPXHwAlK5eKDyt5aecgrWh5jS3v
- **WearEnglish**: a smartwatch app for learning English developed for Samsung Gear S2 within "Ukrainian Inside" — a national programming contest held by Samsung. The app is no longer available, though the Google Slides presentation can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CaEmYqFKlGmmMadr_-wXEg2cbLdHl9S3pNte4PGT6_Q) (in Ukrainian).
- [**KBD**](https://github.com/milesmcc/kbd): a Chrome extension that adds predictive keyboard shortcuts using machine learning algorithms in order to make online browsing faster and accessible to people with disabilities.
- **Decrypth**: a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1tAskUylY71ErSjFWh4fA) containing a series of CS puzzles, solving which leads to a secret Telegram channel (discontinued).
- **CHCKR**: a natural language processing model for analyzing essays on more general topics than merely grammar (i.e. semantics, structure, flow, etc). The project have been since discontinued, though a private repository on BitBucket containing basic functionality is still available.

I have also completed Coursera's "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng in 2015, and have since been interested in machine learning.
