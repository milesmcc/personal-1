**I am interested in how technology affects people politically, economically, and personally. My short-term objectives include building Harpocrate — a [Politiwatch 501(c)(3)](https://politiwatch.org/) initiative established to provide transparency in privacy policies, collaborating with CoSpace Robotics to bring accessible programming education to US students from underprivileged backgrounds, and developing Plutus — a financial technology startup backed by Silicon Valley investors. I am also the creator of [Icy Bounce](https://icybounce.com) — a mobile arcade game featured by Apple in 70+ countries with more than 250,000 downloads, and a mentor at [Ukraine Global Scholars 501(c)(3)](https://ukraineglobalscholars.org) — a non-profit that in less than five years of existence helped more than 50 talented Ukrainian high school students receive over 15 million dollars to study in the top-rated schools worldwide.**

**In my free time I play the guitar, write electronic music, or read about finance & information security.**

## Academics
#### Phillips Academy Andover, a private boarding school in Massachussetts, 2017-2020
In 2017, I received a full scholarship partially funded by Davis Scholars Foundation (see below) to attend Phillips Academy — a leading preporatory school in the United States. I came from an average Ukrainian public school in a small city of Kropyvnytskyi, and was the fourth Ukrainian student to ever attend the school in its 240 years of existence. My latest term GPA was 5.8 on 6.0 scale, and I am taking the following courses in the Fall of 2019:
- **Fluid Mechanics**, a Physics Elective (PHY630)
- **Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra**, a Math Elective (MTH650)
- **Computer Vision**, an Honors Computer Science Seminar (CSC630)
- **Accelerated Chinese Sequence**, Fourth Level (CHI420)
- An English Elective (TBD)

#### Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies (SPCS), Business & Entrepreneurship Section, 2018 
I received a full scholarship to attend a three-week-long selective summer session at Stanford University. My particular section focused in finance & investments, and I was the only Ukrainian student in the entire SPCS program in 2018.

#### Davis Scholars, 2017-present
Along with my admission to Phillips Academy in 2017, I was also selected by the admission office to become one of the few students in the school and of the ~40 students worldwide to receive a $60,000 scholarship that contributed to my $190,000 scholarship at Phillips Academy and will contribute $80,000 to the tuition at a college in the United States if I am admitted to a Davis-affiliated school. Upon the Davis Scholars meeting in New York City in 2018, I built a website for Davis Scholars that lists the scholarship recipients and their schools on an interactive 3D model of Earth, under the guidance of Lance Odden — head of the program.

#### Ukraine Global Scholars (UGS), 501(c)(3), 2016
Following my first attempt a year before, in 2016 I was selected as one of the 19 students from 500+ applicants to receive guidance with the application process to private U.S. schools. With the help of UGS, I applied to 13 independent boarding schools in the United States and gained admission to Phillips Academy, where I am currently enrolled, as well as three other preporatory schools. I also hold several leadership positions in the organization that are described below.

## Leadership Positions & Organizations
#### Admission Officer, Technology Lead, and Mentor at Ukraine Global Scholars 501(c)(3), 2016-2019
- Mentored two UGS scholars in 2018 to apply to boarding schools. They received over $400,000 in scholarship money and will be attending Phillips Academy and The Taft School in the Fall of 2019. 
- Built an updated website for Ukraine Global Scholars — https://ukraineglobalscholars.org/. Responsible for building a new application platform in 2020.
- The only high school student to become an Admission Officer at UGS.

#### Co-Founder at Harpocrate, a [Politiwatch](https://politiwatch.org/) 501(c)(3) initiative, 2019
Harpocrate is an initiative that strives to establish transparency in the realm of online privacy. It is a logical extension of [OpenPD](https://openpd.org/) — a standardized privacy policy standard currently in development by Politiwatch. Harpocrate ventures to create a lookup system that uses intelligent algorithms, including machine learning, to process the contents of privacy policies and present them in an easily digestible way. Such output will be displayed in a browser extension and could then be verified by companies if they write their policies in OpenPD standard — thus popularizing the standard and increasing privacy accountability online. Harpocrate is being developed in collaboration with [Miles McCain](https://rmrm.io/), the founder of Politiwatch.

#### Co-Founder at Plutus, a financial technology startup, 2019
Plutus is an innovative platform to trade financial securities, specificially options, currently in development. It is in its early development stage, although it is already supported by influential Silicon Valley entrepreneurs (NDA).

#### Co-Founder at Dr. Penguin Studios (c), 2017-present
Dr. Penguin Studios is an (unregistered) indie game development company I founded that consists of three people. We have collaborated at Global Game Jam Ukraine in 2017, and have since developed [Icy Bounce](https://icybounce.com/) — a 3D arcade mobile game inspired by Crossy Road. The development took around a year, and the game was ultimately featured by Apple on the App Store in more than 70 countries in the _New Games We Like_ section. Currently, Icy Bounce has more than a quarter million downloads worldwide, and is translated to 13 languages. Icy Bounce received offers to republish by multiple billion-dollar companies (NDA), though the collaboration was never reached due to non-competitive retention rates of Icy Bounce.

#### Co-Founder of the Electronic Music Production Club at Phillips Academy
In 2018, together with Keishi Kimura, I applied for an [Abbot Grant](https://www.andover.edu/alumni/alumni-connect/abbot-academy/abbot-academy-fund) and received $9,500 in funding to establish the infrastructure for electronic music production at Phillips Academy. We have purchased various cutting-the-edge software and hardware to make electronic music accessible to everyone at the school, and are currently working on electronic music production curriculum together with the Music Department. We have also collaborated with the Communications Office and various student musicians to create "Andover in A Minor" — the most viewed video on Phillips Academy's Instagram account (YouTube version: https://youtu.be/6DSYlv96ZPA). 

#### President at [Blueshells](https://blueshells.net/), Co-President at [Techmasters](https://techmasters.io) & Computer Science Club at Phillips Academy
In 2018, I was elected the co-president of Techmasters — the oldest computer science club at Andover. I was reelected again in 2019 and will serve as the club's co-president
