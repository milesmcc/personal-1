**I am a senior at Phillips Academy interested in how technology affects people politically, economically, and personally. My projects include Harpocrate — an initiative to establish transparency in privacy policies; Plutus — an innovative financial securities trading platform (in development); and Icy Bounce — a mobile arcade game featured by Apple and downloaded over 250,000 times.**
