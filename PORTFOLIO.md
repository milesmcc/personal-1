**I am interested in how technology affects people politically, economically, and personally. My short-term objectives include building Harpocrate — a [Politiwatch 501(c)(3)](https://politiwatch.org/) initiative established to provide transparency in privacy policies, collaborating with CoSpace Robotics to bring accessible programming education to US students from underprivileged backgrounds, and developing Plutus — a financial technology startup backed by Silicon Valley investors. I am also the creator of [Icy Bounce](https://icybounce.com) — a mobile arcade game featured by Apple in 70+ countries & downloaded over 250,000 times, and a mentor at [Ukraine Global Scholars 501(c)(3)](https://ukraineglobalscholars.org) — a non-profit that in less than five years of existence helped more than 50 talented Ukrainian high school students receive over 15 million dollars to study in the top-rated schools worldwide.**

**In my free time I play the guitar, write electronic music, or read about finance & information security.**

## Academics
#### Phillips Academy, a private boarding school in Massachussetts, 2017-2020
In 2017, I received a full scholarship partially funded by Davis Scholars Foundation (see below) to attend Phillips Academy — a leading preporatory school in the United States. I came from an average Ukrainian public school in a small city of Kropyvnytskyi, and was the fourth Ukrainian student to ever attend the school in its 240 years of existence. My latest term GPA was 5.8 on 6.0 scale, and I am taking the following courses in the Fall of 2019:
- **Fluid Mechanics**, a Physics Elective (PHY630)
- **Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra**, a Math Elective (MTH650)
- **Computer Vision**, an Honors Computer Science Seminar (CSC630)
- **Accelerated Chinese Sequence**, Fourth Level (CHI420)
- An English Elective (TBD)

#### Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies (SPCS), Business & Entrepreneurship Section, 2018 
I received a full scholarship to attend a three-week-long selective summer session at Stanford University that focused in finance & investments. I was the only Ukrainian student in the entire SPCS program in 2018.

#### Davis Scholars, 2017-present
Along with my admission to Phillips Academy in 2017, I was also selected by the admission office to become one of the few students in the school and of the ~40 students worldwide to receive a $60,000 scholarship that contributes to my $190,000 tuition at Phillips Academy and will contribute $80,000 to the tuition at a college in the United States if I am admitted to a Davis-affiliated school. Upon the Davis Scholars meeting in New York City in 2018, I built a website for Davis Scholars that lists the scholarship recipients and their schools on an interactive 3D model of Earth, under the guidance of Lance Odden — head of the program.
